Summary:
SOD2 protein gene in human and mouse:
score: 1091
normalised score:  4.914414414414415

SOD2 protein gene of human and random sequence:
percentage identify:  5.43%
score:  -246
normalised score:  -1.1131221719457014
edit distance:  209

SOD2 protein gene of mouse and random sequence:
percentage identify:  4.98%
total score:  -256
normalised score:  -1.158371040723982
edit distance:  210

So the gene sequence similarity between SOD2 of human and mouse is the highest.

Interpretation:
Since human and mouse are both mammal animals, and we compare both the SOD2 protein in them. However, the random sequence is random so it does not include meaningful information in the sequence. Thus, the sequence in human and mouse should have high similarity.
