summary:
the similarity between the SOD2 protein in human and mouse is 0.8963963963963963
the similarity between the SOD2 protein of human and random sequence is 0.05429864253393665
the similarity between the SOD2 protein of mouse and random sequence is 0.049773755656108594
so the similarity between human and mouse is the highest

interpretation:
Since human and mouse are both mammal animals, and we compare both the SOD2 protein in them. However, the random sequence is random so it does not include meaningful information in the sequence. Thus, the sequence in human and mouse should have high similarity.
