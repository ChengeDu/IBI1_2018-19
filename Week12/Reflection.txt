This practical was a bit challenging to me. I completed the first two questions quickly but met some problems in the third program. Since I did not use copy() to copy the content of one list to another one, but used infected=renewinfected for copy, I got wrong answer at first. I addressed this problem by printing and comparing these two lists. Moreover, I got only the last figure in the console. After asking my professor for help, I found that I need to create a new figure each time when I want to show.

I enjoyed this practical and I learnt how to use Python to model a probabilistic problem with numpy.random.choice() function. Moreover, I learnt how to draw a figure showing the change trend. This will help me when I want analyze the trend of a probabilistic incidence or analyze data from experiment.
